# political-compass - work-in-progress

The brief for this project is to build a multi-axis model of political thought. The model should take in user input and generate an output as a point on the political compass. The result should be displayed through a UI via a multi-axis graph.

The specific terms and definitions of political thought included in this model must be well established, clearly defined and without ambiguity.
