# Political Compass - work-in-progress

The brief for this project is to build a multi-axis model of political thought. The model should take in user input and generate an output as a point on the political compass. The result should be displayed through a UI via a multi-axis graph.

The user input part of this model works by recording a user's opinion in response to a series of political statements. Each of the user's options for response will be assigned a slightly different value which will influence the position of the user along both political axes.

The specific terms and definitions of political thought included in this model must be well established, clearly defined and without ambiguity. Furthermore, each question should be without ambiguity and should be equally relevant to all response options.

## Design Thoughts/Questions

- How many statement categories should exist?
- How many statements should be included?
- How long should the test take to complete?
- Should the questions be based on current UK public policies?
- Should this model be made specific to UK politics? - this could be done by referencing real examples in some statements. Though, this may see questions receive less objective responses.
- The bias of the creator must be considered - a solution could be an independent project review?

## Ideologies

Based on established and supported poltical ideologies:

## Statements

Yet to be defined but will likely be categorised and based on the political spectrum from:
